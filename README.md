# ois-hack
It takes control over some IoT of no pain no game expo.

From [source](http://wrocenter.pl/pl/no-pain-no-game-fur/):
>OIS - the one-way interaction sculpture, is an ironic answer for web communication. Paradoxically, in OIS entertainment the web-user, not the gallery guest, controls reality all the time.

>Your task is to TURN OFF the lamp in real world, TURNING ON is available only in virtual world (via website).

Let's accept the challenge and smash guests of Art Center ;]!
